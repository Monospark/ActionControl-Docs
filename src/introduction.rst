About
=====

ActionControl is a plugin for Minecraft servers implementing the `Sponge API <https://www.spongepowered.org>`_.
It allows you to react on almost every action performed by a player on your server.
With ActionControl you can currently control the following actions:

* Mining blocks
* Placing blocks
* Interacting with blocks
* Interacting with entities
* Attacking entities
* Using items
* Crafting items

Currently, these are the only actions that are supported.
But there are a lot more planned and will be also implemented when the Sponge API supports them.
To get an overview over everything that is planned, you can visit the :doc:`planned features <planned-features>` page.

Releases
========

Releases and their changelog can be found at the `GitHub releases page <https://github.com/Monospark/ActionControl/releases>`_.
The usage of these builds is recommended because they are stable and were tested using a major Sponge release.

Development builds
==================

Development builds can be downloaded from the `continuous integration server <https://ci.monospark.org/job/ActionControl>`_.
These are unstable and untested but might include bug fixes or additional features.

Installation
============

After you downloaded ActionControl, simply move the jar file into the mods folder of your SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla server.
Read the :doc:`configuration guide <configuration>` to learn how to create powerful config files.
