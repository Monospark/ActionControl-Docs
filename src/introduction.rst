What is ActionControl?
======================

ActionControl is a plugin for Minecraft servers implementing the `Sponge API <https://www.spongepowered.org>`__.
It allows you to control almost every action a player can perform on your server.
These actions can range from breaking and placing blocks to crafting and enchanting items.
ActionControl allows you to control the following actions:

* Breaking blocks
* Placing blocks
* Interacting with blocks
* Interacting with entities
* Using items

Currently, these are the only actions that are supported.
But there are a lot more planned and will be also implemented when the Sponge API supports them.
To get an overview over everything that is planned, you can visit the :doc:`Planned Features </planned>` page.

Downloads
=========

Since there is no official plugin repository yet, you can download the latest builds of ActionControl from the `continuous integration server <https://ci.monospark.org/jobs/ActionControl>`__.

Getting Started
===============

To use ActionControl successfully, there are some prerequisites that need to be fulfilled.
First of all, you need a working SpongeForge or SpongeVanilla server.
On top of that, you also need a working permissions plugin like `PermissionsEx <https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/permissionsex-v2-0/6198>`__.

After you downloaded ActionControl, move the jar file into the mods folder.
